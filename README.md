# Icelandic Corpus of Early Nineteenth-Century Correspondence (ICENCC)
An electronic rendition of a collection of diplomatic and semi-normalised editions of private letters using [Google Tesseract-OCR](https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/) and [Skrambi](http://bin.arnastofnun.is/skrambi/) for post-correction. ICENCC was intended as an extension to the [LCLV19 letter corpus](http://brefasafn.arnastofnun.is/) of data up until the middle of the nineteenth century and currently consists of 670 letters written by 26 scribes, approx. 425,000 words. See the [letter inventory](https://github.com/heimirfreyr/ICENCC/blob/master/Texts/Br%C3%A9faskr%C3%A1_1800-1850.ods) for more details.
